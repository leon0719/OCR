1_crop_1.jpg	TAIWAN BELONGS TO TAIWANESE!
1_crop_2.jpg	December
1_crop_3.jpg	1978
1_crop_4.jpg	FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
1_crop_5.jpg	With the United States's formal recognition of the People's Republic
1_crop_6.jpg	of China,the myth that the Nationallst Chinese regime on Taiwan is the
1_crop_7.jpg	legitimate government of China is finally laid to rest.
1_crop_8.jpg	Whlie we welcome the normalization between the U.S. and the PRC,
1_crop_9.jpg	we take strong exception to the PRC's claim that Taiwan is part of China.
1_crop_10.jpg	By claiming that the Taiwan issue is "entirely China's internal affair",
1_crop_11.jpg	the PRC contradicts every word of its own self-proclaimed anti-hegemony
1_crop_12.jpg	policy. Taiwan belongs to the l7 million people in Taiwan.
1_crop_13.jpg	They
1_crop_14.jpg	aspire to become a new and independent country free from Chinese interfere
1_crop_15.jpg	whether Nationalist or Communist.
1_crop_16.jpg	rule of the Nationalist Chiniese. In light of the severe setback on the
1_crop_17.jpg	diplomatic front and with internal unrest rising rapidly, we expect the reglme
1_crop_18.jpg	to intensify its repressive measures. Chiang Ching-kuo has announced
1_crop_19.jpg	that the 30-year-old martial laws will be fully enforced, and that the
1_crop_20.jpg	upcoming partial congressional elections, in which the reglme was facing
1_crop_21.jpg	unprecedented challenges from the opposition, have been indefinitely
1_crop_22.jpg	postponed. However, the stepped-up repressive measures will only accelerate
1_crop_23.jpg	the collapse of the Chiang regime.
1_crop_24.jpg	We maintain that Talwan's security can only be guaranteed by
1_crop_25.jpg	establishing an independent Taiwan with a democratic and representative
1_crop_26.jpg	government. And we, the Taiwanese the world over, shall continue our
1_crop_27.jpg	struggle toward this end through every possible means.
2_crop_0.jpg	January 23, 1978
2_crop_1.jpg	A STATEMENT ON THE SECURITY OF TAIWAN
2_crop_2.jpg	In the aftermath of the US-PRC normalization, the security of Taiwan
2_crop_3.jpg	is again brought into limelight. While we are concerned with the potential
2_crop_4.jpg	invasion from China, we can not overlcok the current threat to the well-
2_crop_5.jpg	being of thc 17 mlllion Taiwanese people from within,i.e., the suffering
2_crop_6.jpg	inflicted upon the people by the Nationolist Chinese regime headed by
2_crop_7.jpg	Chiang Ching-kuo.
2_crop_9.jpg	For thirty years, the Taiwanese people have been suppressed
2_crop_10.jpg	under martial laws.
2_crop_11.jpg	human rights. No national election has been held since 1948. The Chiong
2_crop_12.jpg	They have been denied fundamental political and
2_crop_13.jpg	regime maintains its control through secret police tactics.
2_crop_14.jpg	underneath the superficial stability, there lies the ever-rising discontent
2_crop_15.jpg	However.
2_crop_16.jpg	and unrest
2_crop_17.jpg	After the US-PRC normalization waa anncunced, the Chiang regime
2_crop_18.jpg	stepped up its repressive measures by reinforcing the 30-year-old martial
2_crop_19.jpg	laws, and "indefinitely suspending" the partial congressional elections
2_crop_20.jpg	scheduled for December 23, 1978 in which the reglme was confronted with
2_crop_21.jpg	unprecedented challenges from the opposition. Furthermore, all political
2_crop_22.jpg	and human rights activists have been placed under close surveillance
2_crop_23.jpg	which eventually led to the arrest of Mr.Yu Teng-fo, a 76-year-old
2_crop_24.jpg	prominent opposition ieader, who is being charged with "suspected involvement
2_crop_25.jpg	in rebellion" on January 21, 1979. All these were done on the pretence of
2_crop_26.jpg	"safeguarding against Communist (Chinese) subversion." It is expected that
2_crop_27.jpg	more arrests will be made against other prominent and vocal opposition
2_crop_28.jpg	leaders.
2_crop_29.jpg	Under these circumstances, we emphatically maintain that-Taiwan's
2_crop_30.jpg	security hinges on having a democratic and representative government in
2_crop_31.jpg	which the Taiwanese people can trust, and rally behind. Before the PRC
2_crop_32.jpg	reaches a position to take over Taiwan by force, there must be an
2_crop_33.jpg	independent Republic of Taiwan, free from Chinese interference, whether
2_crop_34.jpg	Nationelist or Communist. Then, and only then, the Taiwanese people
3_crop_0.jpg	HINESE AMERICANS AND THE CULTURAL QUESTION OF TAIWAN
3_crop_1.jpg	< Continued. from Sectlon 12 >
3_crop_2.jpg	Partly due to political expediency in having to place
3_crop_3.jpg	under one government 900 million people that is iarger fn
3_crop_4.jpg	size and nore heterogeneous and diversified in ethnicity
3_crop_5.jpg	than the whole of Europe and partly due to the tradition of
3_crop_6.jpg	absolute submission-to-the-unlimited-official power Conti-
3_crop_7.jpg	nental Chinese governments (Nationalist and Communist) tend
3_crop_8.jpg	to practice a policy of conformity to the dominant culture
3_crop_9.jpg	and create a phobia against disunity and foreign invasion.
3_crop_10.jpg	Through strictly controlled mass media and school education,
3_crop_11.jpg	the people are conditioned to suppress differences and react
3_crop_12.jpg	hysterically against cultural innovation stimulated by
3_crop_13.jpg	foreign influence."Life is therefore usually hard and
3_crop_14.jpg	inhumane for those who have grown up in a different culture
3_crop_15.jpg	and received education meant for a different social and
3_crop_16.jpg	political system. It is difficult to have to live under
3_crop_17.jpg	such a government with the assumption that any differences
3_crop_18.jpg	among Chinese should be minor and can be "corrected" easily.
3_crop_19.jpg	The Nationalists are claiming that there will be no great
3_crop_20.jpg	problems in carrying out their "re-educational" policy of
3_crop_21.jpg	the Taiwanese population to delearn their foreign traits and
3_crop_22.jpg	to relearn their "genuine" Chtnese ingredients. Taiwanese
3_crop_23.jpg	who are brave and fortunate enough to speak out outside the
3_crop_24.jpg	Nationalist control have voiced their suffering and resentment
3_crop_25.jpg	of the life under such a policy perpetually suppressing the
3_crop_26.jpg	status of the Taiwanese language and any part of the Taiwan-
3_crop_27.jpg	ese culture that the Nationalists view as a deviation. The
3_crop_28.jpg	Peking government is claiming that the Taiwanese have been
3_crop_29.jpg	suffering because of the "reactionary" Nationalists, and
3_crop_30.jpg	when it takes over Taiwan, their re-educational program will
3_crop_31.jpg	be welcomed by the Taiwanese because it will really do them
3_crop_32.jpg	good The Taiwanese have voiced their opposition to such a
3_crop_33.jpg	contention even more strongly.
3_crop_34.jpg	They have opted for a government of, by, and for the
3_crop_35.jpg	people of Taiwan, whtch .certainly will carry out poiicies
4_crop_0.jpg	that favor the natural growth of a Marine Chinese culture,
4_crop_1.jpg	instead of the current Nationalist policy of promoting a
4_crop_2.jpg	Continental Chinese culture.
4_crop_3.jpg	Those Chinese Americans who have a better understanding
4_crop_4.jpg	of their own rights, desires and culture are generally
4_crop_5.jpg	responsive to the Taiwanese voices. They see that Chinese
4_crop_6.jpg	in both Taiwan and China will be benefited greatly if their
4_crop_7.jpg	governments allow their people to iearn from each other's
4_crop_8.jpg	desirable part of culture. They would like to seq both
4_crop_9.jpg	governments make more genuine efforts to achieve higher
4_crop_10.jpg	standards of living, as well as economic and political
4_crop_11.jpg	equality, and to carry on cultural exchange and scientific
4_crop_12.jpg	cooperation wich the rest of the worid.
4_crop_13.jpg	Chinese Americans wonder if their own image and status
4_crop_14.jpg	will rise if China should get even bigger and stronger by
4_crop_15.jpg	annexing Taiwan through a means less civilized than abiding
4_crop_16.jpg	by the wishes of the people through ballots. And, most of
4_crop_17.jpg	all, they would hate to see themselves undergo a large-scale
4_crop_18.jpg	cultural plan for delearning and relearning.
4_crop_19.jpg	Those who believe in the Confucian teaching, "Do not do
4_crop_20.jpg	to others what you do not want others to do to you" will not
4_crop_21.jpg	support-Peking's claim over Taiwan. Those who take serious-
4_crop_22.jpg	ly the Christian teaching of "Do unto others what you want
4_crop_23.jpg	others to do unto you" will advocate self-determination for
4_crop_24.jpg	the people of Taiwan or political reform through which the
4_crop_25.jpg	present government can be transformed into a government of,
4_crop_26.jpg	by, and for the Marine Chinese community on Taiwan.
4_crop_27.jpg	Thus, today, "overseas" Chinese education has changed
4_crop_28.jpg	greatly, especially in the U.S. and the Republic of Singa-
4_crop_29.jpg	pore, where the goals of Chinese education are well studied
4_crop_30.jpg	and defined in the light of community needs; cultural
4_crop_31.jpg	identity, and national perspectives.
4_crop_32.jpg	Such change has been affected by the attitudal change
4_crop_33.jpg	from a sojourner's mentality to the mentality of a settler
4_crop_34.jpg	and will affect their attitudes further.
4_crop_35.jpg	The attitudal difference between the Marine Chinese
4_crop_36.jpg	old-timers and the Contipental Chinese newcomers is well-
4_crop_37.jpg	reflected in the recent Pro-Taiwan demonstrations against
4_crop_38.jpg	Carter's handling of normalization with China.
4_crop_39.jpg	timers tend to hold signs which read "Protect Taiwan",
4_crop_40.jpg	The oid-
4_crop_41.jpg	Keep Taiwan Free", or the like.
4_crop_42.jpg	comers hold signs, usually in Chinese, saying "The only
4_crop_43.jpg	The new-
4_crop_44.jpg	China is the Repubiic of China".
4_crop_45.jpg	The Chinese in Singapore are even more conscious of
4_crop_46.jpg	their cultural identity. In referring to their nationality,
4_crop_47.jpg	they call themselves Singaporean. In referring to their
4_crop_48.jpg	racial affiliation, they insist on usirg "Huaren" which
4_crop_49.jpg	means 'racially Chinese' and ask the Nationalist government
4_crop_50.jpg	not to call then "Chungkuoren", which literally means 'People
4_crop_51.jpg	of the Middie Kingdom', People of 'China', or 'people with
4_crop_52.jpg	Chinese nationality'.
4_crop_53.jpg	They also refused to be called "Hua-
4_crop_54.jpg	chiau, which is usually translated as 'overseas Chinese',
4_crop_55.jpg	but the second syllable of the term means 'sojourner' (and
4_crop_56.jpg	hence with the intention of returning to China).
4_crop_57.jpg	The mass media in Taiwan continue to call them "Chung-
4_crop_58.jpg	kuoren" or Hua-chiau" however, because, to the Nationalists,
4_crop_59.jpg	all Chinese outside of Communist control still have their
4_crop_60.jpg	Chinese nationality even after they are naturalized in their
4_crop_61.jpg	country of residence and are supposed to be loyal to and
5_crop_0.jpg	LONG-TERM PROSPECTS
5_crop_1.jpg	What will happen to Taiwan in the
5_crop_2.jpg	long run? Here are two scenarios:
5_crop_3.jpg	Scenario I.After the failure of attempts
5_crop_4.jpg	to "unify" Taiwan by peaceful means.
5_crop_5.jpg	China launches all-out economic war
5_crop_6.jpg	fare Peking declares that.Taiwan is a
5_crop_7.jpg	province of China,labels the government
5_crop_8.jpg	a rebellious group and imposes an eco-
5_crop_9.jpg	nomic blockade.It severely disrupts Tai-
5_crop_10.jpg	wan's trade,discourages foreign invest-
5_crop_11.jpg	ments and causes a fight of capital,panic
5_crop_12.jpg	and popular unrest. The U.S. and japan
5_crop_13.jpg	issue protests,claimingChina is violating
5_crop_14.jpg	earlier assurances, but Peking rejects
5_crop_15.jpg	these as interference in its domestic af-
5_crop_16.jpg	fairs and intensifies the economic stran-
5_crop_17.jpg	gulation of Taiwan: Unwilling to provoke
5_crop_18.jpg	China,which has become a much strong-
5_crop_19.jpg	ereconomic and military power thanks to
5_crop_20.jpg	Japan's massive economic assistance and
5_crop_21.jpg	American technological aid,the U.S takes
5_crop_22.jpg	no action except to express concern for
5_crop_23.jpg	the Taiwanese people.
5_crop_24.jpg	Scenario 2. Peking launches a large-
5_crop_25.jpg	scale bombardment of Quemoy and Mat-
5_crop_26.jpg	su,as it did in 1958.Without U.S.support,
5_crop_27.jpg	the Nationalists are unable to resupply
5_crop_28.jpg	and reinforce their forces there.Quemoy
5_crop_29.jpg	and Matsu fall,and 100,000 of the Nation-
5_crop_30.jpg	alists'best troops become prisoners of the
5_crop_31.jpg	Communists. Peking calls for negotia-
5_crop_32.jpg	tions to work out the absorption of
5_crop_33.jpg	Taiwan, and the Nationalists have no re-
5_crop_34.jpg	course but to accept Peking's terms.The
5_crop_35.jpg	world witnesses a massive exodus of
5_crop_36.jpg	"boat people"from Taiwan.
5_crop_37.jpg	Admittedly,these are "worst possible
5_crop_38.jpg	if China's leaders honur the understand-
5_crop_39.jpg	ing Hua Kuo-feng and Teng Hsiao-ping
5_crop_40.jpg	gave to Carter. But what if China's future
5_crop_41.jpg	leaders choose not to be bound by it and
5_crop_42.jpg	proceed to "liberate"
5_crop_43.jpg	Taiwan by force?
5_crop_44.jpg	Taiwan cannot depend for its survival
5_crop_45.jpg	on the changing whims of the Peking
5_crop_46.jpg	leadership. Nor can it rely on the protec-
6_crop_0.jpg	WASHINGTON-Time magazine
6_crop_1.jpg	has selected Teng Hsiao-ping, Red
6_crop_2.jpg	China's deputy premier, as its man of
6_crop_3.jpg	the year.But even before this selection
6_crop_4.jpg	became known, Time has paid its
6_crop_5.jpg	respects to the 74-year-old Chinese
6_crop_6.jpg	strongman in its report on the nor-
6_crop_7.jpg	malization between the United States
6_crop_8.jpg	and China
6_crop_9.jpg	Time auded the action of President
6_crop_10.jpg	Carter.in accepting Teng's conditions
6_crop_11.jpg	for normalization as "the most
6_crop_12.jpg	momentous.foreign policy announce-
6_crop_13.jpg	ment of Jimmy Carter's two-year presi-
6_crop_14.jpg	dency and one of the most important in
6_crop_15.jpg	recent.U.S. history"
6_crop_16.jpg	architect of China's Great Leap Out-
6_crop_17.jpg	ward," Time's exaggerated term for
6_crop_18.jpg	the opening of China's door by another
6_crop_19.jpg	six inches However, it failed to give
6_crop_20.jpg	him due credit for having succeeded in
6_crop_21.jpg	getting Jimmy Carter to repudiate
6_crop_22.jpg	another of his campaign promises and
6_crop_23.jpg	drop the one feeble condition that he
6_crop_24.jpg	and two previous presidents had dec-
6_crop_25.jpg	lared to be essential if they were to
6_crop_26.jpg	recognize Peking
7_crop_0.jpg	No word of criticism
7_crop_1.jpg	At the same time, Hua Kuo-feng
7_crop_2.jpg	China's prime minister,reiterated their
7_crop_3.jpg	position, which we now cannot legally
7_crop_4.jpg	dispute, that the way in which Taiwan
7_crop_5.jpg	is returned to their control is entirely
7_crop_6.jpg	China's internal affair.
7_crop_7.jpg	While Time was reporting that
7_crop_8.jpg	Carter thought ho had scored a great
7_crop_9.jpg	diplomatic triumph, it downplayed the
7_crop_10.jpg	corrent of criticism that descended on
7_crop_11.jpg	he White House. No mention was
7_crop_12.jpg	nade of the fact that in the first five
7_crop_13.jpg	lays after the president's announce-
7_crop_14.jpg	ment,over 6,500 telephone calls,
7_crop_15.jpg	telegrams and letters poured into the
7_crop_16.jpg	White House commenting on the deci-
7_crop_17.jpg	sion. Over 77 percent of them were
7_crop_18.jpg	against it.
7_crop_19.jpg	Time mentioned only Republican
7_crop_20.jpg	critics of this move, saying that "many
7_crop_21.jpg	conservatives" accused the administra
7_crop_22.jpg	tion of abandoning Taiwan Linnoticed
7_crop_23.jpg	by this news magazine were such Dem-
7_crop_24.jpg	ooratic critics as Sen Richard Sione of
7_crop_25.jpg	Florida Sen John Glenn of Ohio Rep
7_crop_26.jpg	Lester Wolff of New York, and the
7_crop_27.jpg	redoubtable George Meany, president
7_crop_28.jpg	of the AFL-CIQ, who declared that
7_crop_29.jpg	Carter had renounced his human rights
7_crop_30.jpg	principles in recognizing one of the
7_crop_31.jpg	world's-worst violators of human
7_crop_32.jpg	rights,Red China.
8_crop_0.jpg	the Taiwanese people have developed their
8_crop_1.jpg	own language and culture separate from that
8_crop_2.jpg	of mainland China. Yet under the Kuomin-
8_crop_3.jpg	tang,Taiwanese children are prohibited from
8_crop_4.jpg	speaking their own language in public schools.
8_crop_5.jpg	Even Bibles written in Taiwanese have been
8_crop_6.jpg	confiscated.
8_crop_7.jpg	For nearly 400 years the Taiwanese people
8_crop_8.jpg	have had to fight continued interference by
8_crop_9.jpg	outsiders in their national life and culture. In
8_crop_10.jpg	1624 the Dutch came to the island and
8_crop_11.jpg	deciared it a colony. They were followed by
8_crop_12.jpg	the Spanish, the Ming Dynasty,the Japanese
8_crop_13.jpg	and,finally,Chiang Kai-shek.
8_crop_14.jpg	After Worid War II the allied forces
8_crop_15.jpg	awarded Taiwan to the Republic of China
8_crop_16.jpg	without consulting the Taiwanese pecple.
8_crop_17.jpg	(The island had been a colony of Japan.) On
8_crop_18.jpg	Ching-Chiang Kuo is the president of the
8_crop_19.jpg	Taiwanese Human Rights and Cuiture Assn in
8_crop_20.jpg	Los Angeles.
8_crop_21.jpg	Feb.28,1947,a series of demonstrations were
8_crop_22.jpg	mounted to protest the newly imposed
8_crop_23.jpg	government and to demand political represen-
8_crop_24.jpg	tation for the Taiwanese. Chiang Kai-shek's
8_crop_25.jpg	troops responded by killing thousands of
8_crop_26.jpg	people. Since then, authentic opposition
8_crop_27.jpg	parties have been banned
8_crop_28.jpg	Despite the rigid controls on political life
8_crop_29.jpg	the movement for an independent Taiwan has
8_crop_30.jpg	made some progress.In i977,elections were
8_crop_31.jpg	heid throughout the island for provincial
8_crop_32.jpg	representatives and for municipal offices. The
8_crop_33.jpg	campaign period was limited to 10 to 15 days
8_crop_34.jpg	Only the Kuomintang was allowed media
8_crop_35.jpg	coverage. Nevertheless, 21 independent can-
8_crop_36.jpg	didates managed to win elections
8_crop_37.jpg	Last year,new elections were scheduled for
8_crop_38.jpg	December. On the sixth day of the 15-day
8_crop_39.jpg	campaign. President Carter announced the
9_crop_0.jpg	China's Teng Hsiao-ping showed considerable flex
9_crop_1.jpg	ibllity in sketching.for a delegation of American sena-
9_crop_2.jpg	tors, an autonomous future for Taiwan. He said the is-
9_crop_3.jpg	land could retain its government and armed forces in-
9_crop_4.jpg	definitely along with its non-Communist social and eco-
9_crop_5.jpg	nomic system. And while China would continue to as-
9_crop_6.jpg	sert sovereignty over Taiwan,there was no timetable
9_crop_7.jpg	for its integration with the Communist mainland.
9_crop_8.jpg	It is important to note,however,that Mr.Teng was
9_crop_9.jpg	not thus promising to leave Taiwan alone.The loose ar-
9_crop_10.jpg	rangement he proposed would require negotiations be-
9_crop_11.jpg	tween Peking and the Nationalists on Taiwan,meaning
9_crop_12.jpg	acknowledgement by the Nationalists that China has
9_crop_13.jpg	been at least technically "reunified." They could not
9_crop_14.jpg	claim to be an independent Republic of China or the
9_crop_15.jpg	fightful government of all China. Even if Mr.Teng's
10_crop_0.jpg	offer has no other hidden conditlons, It would require
10_crop_1.jpg	President Chiang Ching-kuo and his assoclates in the
10_crop_2.jpg	Taiwan administration to consider some painful steps.
10_crop_3.jpg	the Taiwan leaders, backed by some Americans, to
10_crop_4.jpg	spurn Mr.Teng's proposal.In the short run,this looks
10_crop_5.jpg	safe because China does not appear at present to have
10_crop_6.jpg	the means to deprive Taiwan of its independence.But if
10_crop_7.jpg	over time the Nationalists fail to enter into negotiatlons.
10_crop_8.jpg	with Peking, their present safety may disappear As
10_crop_9.jpg	Mr.Teng was careful to warn,an indefinite delay in the
10_crop_10.jpg	start of negotiations would sooner or later cause China
10_crop_11.jpg	to resort to force.
10_crop_12.jpg	We suspect that this is threat and prediction in
10_crop_13.jpg	equal measure. What the United States has hoped to
10_crop_14.jpg	achieve for Talwan, even in breaking off the treaty ties
11_crop_0.jpg	of a generation is an autonomous existence,a contimu-
11_crop_1.jpg	ing high standard of living that depends on a free
11_crop_2.jpg	economy and a reasonable guarantee against conquest
11_crop_3.jpg	──── the very things Mr.Teng seems to have in mind.
11_crop_4.jpg	Since 1972,however, the United States has aiso agreed
11_crop_5.jpg	with both of the rival Chinese Governments that Tai-
11_crop_6.jpg	wan is part of China and that there is only one China.
11_crop_7.jpg	Since then,too, the United States has opposed any set-
11_crop_8.jpg	tlerment by force and urged eventual negotiation.
11_crop_9.jpg	Ideally,reunification over a long period could limit
11_crop_10.jpg	the pain for the people of Taiwan.Mr.Teng pointed a
11_crop_11.jpg	way without breaching the'assumptlons on which Mr.
11_crop_12.jpg	Carter recognized Peking. But for that process to
11_crop_13.jpg	develop, the Taiwan regime will have to conclude one
11_crop_14.jpg	day that it prefers to negotiate for a separate identity
11_crop_15.jpg	rather than on another day to have to fight for it.
12_crop_0.jpg	The overwhelming majority of
12_crop_1.jpg	Americans still believe that the is
12_crop_2.jpg	land of Talwan is under a fair
12_crop_3.jpg	democratic government.They be-
12_crop_4.jpg	lieve that the Talwanese enjoy all
12_crop_5.jpg	the basic freedoms that have been
12_crop_6.jpg	taken for granted in this country,
12_crop_7.jpg	such as freedom of speech, the
12_crop_8.jpg	right to assemble peaceably, and
12_crop_9.jpg	so forth.
12_crop_10.jpg	The stark tuth is, howver, that
12_crop_11.jpg	Taiwan has been ruled by a cruel-
